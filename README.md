# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. The game involves drawing a stick figure being 'hanged' for each incorrect guess until the entire figure is drawn, resulting in a loss.
